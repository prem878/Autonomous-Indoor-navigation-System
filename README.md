# Autonomous-Indoor-navigation-System
Creating an autonomous indoor navigation system for a drone using MATLAB is a complex task that involves various computer vision and robotics principles. The high-level steps you've outlined provide a roadmap for implementing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a webcam. Here's a summary of the process:

**1. Image Acquisition:** Capture frames from the webcam using MATLAB's Image Acquisition Toolbox. Create a video object and set the webcam as the video source.

**2. Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from the acquired images. Common feature extraction methods include corner detection (e.g., Harris corners), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), or speeded-up robust features (SURF).

**3. Feature Matching:** Compare features between consecutive frames to establish correspondences. Use techniques like nearest neighbor matching or RANSAC to robustly match features.

**4. Motion Estimation:** Estimate the camera's motion between frames using the matched feature correspondences. This can involve techniques like the Essential Matrix, Fundamental Matrix, 8-point algorithm, or RANSAC.

**5. Mapping:** Combine the camera's estimated motion with known camera parameters to generate a 3D map of the environment. This is achieved through triangulation of matched feature points or using a Structure from Motion (SfM) approach.

**6. Localization:** Use the generated map and the current frame to estimate the camera's pose (position and orientation) relative to the map. This step involves solving the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problem or employing bundle adjustment algorithms.

**7. Loop Closure:** Detect and handle loop closures to improve accuracy. Loop closures correct accumulated errors by identifying previously visited locations.

**8. Visualization:** Display the estimated camera trajectory and the reconstructed map using MATLAB's visualization capabilities. This includes plotting the camera's path and visualizing the 3D map.

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation of each step can be highly involved and may require fine-tuning and calibration based on your specific drone, camera, and environment. The quality of your results will depend on the accuracy of your feature extraction, matching, motion estimation, and loop closure detection methods, as well as the performance of your hardware.
